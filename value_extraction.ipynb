We construct three scenarios for fairness evaluation: ( 1) evaluation on test sets with different base rate parity (i.e., data with different levels of fairness) in zero- shot settings; ( 2) evaluation under unfair contexts by controlling the base rate parity of demonstrations in few-shot settings to study the influence of unfair contexts on the prediction fairness; ( 3) evaluation under different numbers of fair demonstrations to study how the fairness of GPT models is affected by providing more fair context.\n",

A large base rate parity bPcindicates the bias towards a positive prediction Y= 1 (i.e., high salary) conditioned on A= 1(i.e., male) over A= 0(i.e., female).\n",
